# Corona Pong

A small Pong Clone I made to learn the basics of Corona SDK.

This was mainly to learn how to use Corona SDK itself, so I didn't focus on aesthetics much.

2018 EDIT: I've been using Corona for a while now, and I finally released my first game on Google Play. You can check it out here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icloud.fwcarlitos.newton
